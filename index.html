         <p class=" concept and background_text"> This idea is based on my previous experience working as a barista before and during my time in college. The poster illustrates a step-by-step process for espresso tamping, which is a crucial factor in achieving high-quality espresso. It affects the flow of water and the extraction of espresso oils from the ground coffee beans. The poster presents three (four) key steps I used to follow to achieve optimal espresso quality.</p>
